## UI Ideas

I'm kicking around some ideas for digging into the endangered species hunting game, 'Penguin Hunter' (working title).

![Left Side Slideout UI]({{ site.url }}/images/201410/1013142209a.jpg)

This idea is for an 'off canvas', slide-out UI panel which contains information related to the remaining species in the game.  Since this is going to be a Webplayer game, I'm thinking the > TAB key might be a good choice for sliding out the panel.  

I'm planning on using Unity's new UI feature which is part of the 4.6 Beta build.  The only other UI's I've put together were created with the now discontinued nGUI plugin.  I've watched many of the training video's on the [Unity Learn page](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/ui).

I hope to have an update soon with my progress.
